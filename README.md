## A JEE Application for Measuring Document Similarity  
For this assignment we are required to develop a Java web application that enables two or more text documents to be compared for similarity using Java and Apache Tomcat.  

## Difficulties  
Tomcat has been giving me hassle the last while so I was unable to actually run the applicaiton properly. I also got errors when trying to create the war file in the jaccard folder.
